Stochastic Interpolant Subliminal Learning

Apply ideas from https://github.com/MinhxLe/subliminal-learning/tree/main to stochastic interpolants (toy model, checkerboard target distribution)

Train teacher on transforming NORMAL points to target. Generate a student train set by using the teacher to push forward UNIFORM points. Evaluate both on normal points. Student learns the checkerboard.
